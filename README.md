# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various machine learning projects, including data preprocessing, model training, and analysis. The current project focuses on **Mental Health Analysis** using survey data.

## Project: Mental Health Analysis
- 📊 **Dataset**: `survey.csv`. I have used the dataset provided on this kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/trnguyen1510/ml-mental-health-in-tech-workplace
- 🧠 **Objective**: Analyze mental health patterns using machine learning models.
- 🔍 **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.
