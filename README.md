# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various machine learning projects, including data preprocessing, model training, and analysis. The current project focuses on **Mental Health Analysis** using survey data.

## Project: Mental Health Analysis
- üìä **Dataset**: `survey.csv`. I have used the dataset provided on this kaggle dataset: [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data?select=survey.csv)
- üß† **Objective**: Analyze mental health patterns using machine learning models.
- üîç **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.
